## - Final Year Project
Ubiqutous Communicator

My final year project is with Lucent Technologies. The main goal of the project is to developing a LAN based software using the Win32 API and Winsock API within the VC++.NET framework to facilitate effective communication. The software is an integrated communication suite for project management by abstracting the presence of the network from all users.

Win32 API, WinSockets, VC++
